# magic-square

This is a Genetic algorithm written in Common Lisp which solves nxn magic squares. 

The algorithm takes a set of random guesses and then quantifies the fitness of a particular guess. The best guesses are then combined to create hypothetically better guesses until the desired number of solutions are found.
